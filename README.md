<h1 align=center>Guess The Number ðŸ¤”â˜•</br><img src="https://github.com/aleen42/badges/blob/docs/src/cli.svg"><img src="https://badges.aleen42.com/src/java.svg"></h1>

<p align=justify>It is necessary for the algorithm to generate a random number to be guessed by the user. To do this, I used the random library, generating a random number between 0 and 100 and storing it in the generator <strong>generator</strong>.</p>

<p align=justify>In the main class, a screen introducing the user to the game was implemented, followed by a <strong>while</strong> loop, with the purpose of asking the user for a number again whenever the number is different from the number generated by the program. If the user gets the number right, a victory message is shown on the console and the choice to play again, if the user chooses 's' a new number is generated and the loop is repeated, if 'n' the program is terminated.</p>

<p align=justify>To assist the user in discovering the number, the game checks the number entered by the user and compares it with the generated number, in order to give a hint whether it is larger or smaller. Thinking that the user will make several guesses and the game can restart several times, the <strong>clearConsole</strong> function was also implemented, which clears the console screen when called during the program execution.</p>
